# Music-Genre-Classification-System

The project aims to develop a robust machine learning model, using the K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm, which is capable of accurately classifying a given audio track into one of several music genres based onÂ their low-level features of frequency and time domain.

It involves:

1. Loading the GTZAN dataset of 1000 audio files labeled with genres.

2. Extracting MFCC features from the audio files.

3. Applying the K-NN algorithm to predict the genre of a test audio file based on the majority vote of its k-nearest neighbors.

4. The model's effectiveness is evaluated using a confusion matrix.
